LAS VEGAS (KNPR's State of Nevada) - More than a decade ago, the Pentagon developed digital devices that can be fit into the horn of a bugle and play Taps when a button is pushed.

Even though it may look like someone is playing a bugle, they are actually faking it -- that is, most of the time.

Larry Ransom decided he wasnâ€™t happy about the tinny sound of that fake bugle playing. In 2014, he co-founded TAPPS, which stands for Trumpeters Alliance to Perform Patriotic Services. He and his members actually play bugles at military funerals.
